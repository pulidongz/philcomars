The Mining Agreements layer indicates the location and geographic extent of the legal tenure of contract holders under the Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) or the Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA). MPSAs and FTAAs involve large-scale mining contracts entered into by the Government and qualified contractors, where the Government shares in the production in kind or in value (under MPSA) or provide technical or financial assistance in the exploration, development, or utilization of mineral resources (under FTAA). Both MPSAs and FTAAs can take effect within a period of 25 years that can be renewed for another 25 years.
